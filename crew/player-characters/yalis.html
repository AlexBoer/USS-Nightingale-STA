<li data-line="0" dir="auto"><span class="list-bullet"></span>Yalis spent much of her childhood on <a data-href="Qo'noS" href="shackleton-expanse/locations/qo'nos.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Qo'noS</a>, the Klingon homeworld, where her anthropologist mother studied Klingon culture. </li>

<li data-line="2" dir="auto"><span class="list-bullet"></span>Yalis was in frequent fights with Klingon children.

<li data-line="3" dir="auto"><span class="list-bullet"></span>As a child, she read a book where humans rode horses, and became determined to ride her pet targ.</li>
<li data-line="4" dir="auto"><span class="list-bullet"></span>Her childhood fights and attempted targ-riding led to frequent trips to a Klingon doctor, who eventually performed a <em>bone augmentation/strengthening procedure</em> so she wouldn't keep breaking them. </li>

<li data-line="1" dir="auto"><span class="list-bullet"></span>Yalis has <em>great memory</em> for social interactions. Tell her the name of your dog or kids and she'll remember and ask about them by name when you talk in the future.</li>
<li data-line="2" dir="auto"><span class="list-bullet"></span>She does not follow the path of a Klingon warrior, but she does have <em>a strong sense of honor</em> when it comes to honesty and keeping her word.</li>
<li data-line="3" dir="auto"><span class="list-bullet"></span>She wants a traditional Denobulan family with many wives and husbands, but her sense of romance is Klingon which has kept her from finding any spouses yet.</li>
<li data-line="4" dir="auto"><span class="list-bullet"></span>She has the temper of a Klingon, but she keeps it under such tight wraps that usually <em>only an empath would be able to tell when she's angry</em>. But she survived her childhood by out-Klingoning the Klingon children, and if she perceives someone as a bully they might see a side of her that few people ever meet. </li>
<li data-line="5" dir="auto"><span class="list-bullet"></span>Yalis' favorite place on the ship is the <a data-href="Crop Sciences Lab" href="shackleton-expanse/groups/nightingale/ship-locations/crop-sciences-lab.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Crop Sciences Lab</a>.

The colonists, Gray, and Velara went up to the Nightingale on the shuttle while Siltec, Janus and I stayed on the planet.

They did a very good job convincing the Klingons to cooperate with our handling of the situation, and earned the respect of the Klingons (when Commander Gluk was rude, Velara said she didn't know they let targs command ships). They didn't seem too concerned about D'Loq and Brutog (the two Klingon colonists in sickbay), they were just upset that their ship had been knocked out of warp.<br><br>When Gray and Velara came back to the surface, we opened the monolith.

Kamin joined us for this session as Betazoid doctor Lt. Cmdr. Rennan Kader.<br><br>We delivered presents (mostly weapons, also targs) to Klingon children on several colony planets along the border for the Klingon holiday of Tor'Gos.<br><br>At the first planet we visited (Khitomer), we had to go down in a shuttle because the transporter couldn't reach some of the houses. Klingon children fired surface to air missiles at our shuttle, and we discovered it is customary for Klingon children to attack Klingon Santa (who was named Gar'Nash at first but later mutated to Gash'Nar). We retaliated by beaming balloons full of targ manure over their heads. (Balloons were produced by Rennan and Yalis wrestling a targ and giving it a laxative, then collecting the result.)<br><br>At the second planet we visited (Beta Thoridor) there was subspace-related lightening in the atmosphere, and Valera was able to fly us under it. We completed that delivery pretty quickly. We also discovered there was a pathogen in the targ manure that made our skin emit a pheromone that smelled delicious to some predator animals, but fortunately Rennan was able to program the transporters to eliminate it (assisted by Bas Sa'mi).<br><br>The third planet we visited (H'atoria) seemed uneventful until several Klingon children beamed aboard the ship and attacked Rennan in sickbay. He eventually got them to go out into the hallway by telepathically projecting the voice of Gash'Nar into their heads taunting them about looking in the wrong place. We then distracted them with a holographic Gash'Nar in the hallway, which kept them busy fighting until they could be beamed back to their homes.<br><br>The fourth planet we visited (Gamma Eridon) was on the Klingon-Romulan border and had colonists of both species on the planet. Three Romulan ships were on the planet and tried to stop us from "delivering weapons to the planet". We attempted to explain to the Romulans that they were "childrens' weapons" and demonstrated the use of a targ poop balloon (Rennan threw it an Yalis), but the Romulans weren't convinced. We beamed targs onto the Romulan ships to keep them distracted while we made our deliveries, and then some clever flying by Valera (plus a targ chewing something near a Romulan warp core - thanks Kamin!) got us out of there without the Romulans being able to follow.<br><br>The last planet we visited was Narendra, an important planet in the history of Klingon-Federation relations (this is where Captain Garret of the Enterprise-C made her heroic sacrifice to save Klingons from a Romulan sneak attack). Tor'Gos celebrations on this world typically involve a federation ship flying over the planet and detonating in the sky to commemorate the occasion. We decided that we would do something to the warp drive of a shuttle to make it able to sky-write Qapla' in glowing letters over the planet, then blow it up. Valera decided to fly the shuttle herself instead of having it on auto-pilot, but it didn't go well and she knocked the head off the statue of Captain Garret. Yalis was supposed to beam her out before the shuttle exploded, but our timing was off and Yalis beamed her out <em>while</em> the shuttle was exploding. Fortunately Rennan was able to heroically pull her back from the brink of death and she survived.<br><br>Throughout the mission, Valera pushed the engines to their limits and got us places quickly. We made all of our deliveries.

Yalis swung around on the stalactites and shined light in Siltec's eyes to blind him. Siltec threw Relza at her. Siltec thought he had won, but since his phaser was pointed at Relza (who was on Yalis), Yalis grabbed Siltec's ankle to pull him to the ground, then took his hat hostage to win the sparring.<br><br>Vrenta Awasi and Admiral Stoker met us at the doors to the holodeck with a mission, and gave us a data PADD with information about an artifact recently stolen from the station. The block looked like sandstone, was a few feet in size was gem-shaped like a mini-monolith, and had runes on it like we had encountered at Baccus 3. The artifact was found on the nearby planet Dinassia 2. It was scanned before the theft - no energy emissions, but it had certain alloys under the surface (they couldn't scan much deeper). It was stolen 2 days ago, after the Nightingale had deactivated the Baccus 3 monolith.<br><br>We checked out the archive it was stolen from - someone had entered without using the door, and we found a transporter signature consistent with Orien transporters. There was only one Orien ship in the area recently, the SS Castlerock, a freighter/merchant ship under the command of Captain Peljara. We told Admiral Stoker what we found, then took the runabout the McKenzie to go after them.<br><br>We caught up with the McKenzie near the edge of the Romulan neutral zone. Subspace waves were present, and Yalis applied the debluer modifications to the runabout's deflector to create subspace shielding.<br><br>Velara told them they had forgotten to pay the "neutral zone identification fee" (implying an Orien bribe), and they agreed to let us onboard. Before we came onboard, the back end of the Casterock appeared to be crushed like a can, there was a containment breach, and things started to float out but were then pulled back in.
