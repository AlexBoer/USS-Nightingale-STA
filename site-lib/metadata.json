Her father was away for work most of her life, and she didn’t really know why. After she graduated from Admiral Kathryn Janeway Highschool, she joined Starfleet Academy on a Security track. During her time in the academy, she received word that her father had been killed, and she thought about quitting, but decided to continue on in his memory. After she graduated, she was assigned to the USS Firebrand, a Freedom Class ship as a Security officer. During her time on the Firebrand, she developed the skills required to be a Combat Medic by working closely with the ships doctor.About a year after joining her crew, they were patrolling near Wolf-359, when they received a hail from the USS Melbourne that the Borg had been sighted. Rushing to her aid, they watched in horror as the Borg destroyed the Melbourne. During the Battle, the Firebrand was critically damaged, and the Captain ordered the full evacuation of the crew. On her way to the escape pods, she watched a bulkhead blow infront of her, and suck out everyone into space before a force field sprang up, saving her life. Only her and the XO, Cmdr T’prel, survived. They spent 3 days floating in the debris field of the battle, not knowing if, or when, they would be rescued.After being rescued, the two were returned to Earth for debriefing, and Holly wanted to resign her commission, but Commander T’prel convinced her that that would be an insult to the memory of the crew they lost. She was promoted to a Full Lieutenant, and assigned to the USS Fresno, a California Class ship, and placed in charge of the security department. She spent the next 4 years of her life on the Fresno, before she requested some shore leave for the Anniversary of Wolf 359.Holly traveled back to Earth to meet up with Commander T’prel, who had recently been promoted to Captain. Captain T’prel informed her that she was now working with Starfleet Inelegance, and that she wanted Holly to join her, so they could work to stop another event like Wolf 359 before it even happened. What was supposed to be a quick weekend trip to remember fallen friends and crew, turned into a shift in her career. Now officially working for Intelligence, she was sent on an assignment to gather information about a new cell of the Maquis operating out of The Badlands. While investigating, she stumbled upon a small craft trying to smuggle goods off of Bajor, and was able to apprehend the pilot. Turning him over to Starfleet, she was able to ascertain where the goods were being smuggled to, and transferred the intelligence to T’prel.She then spent the next 7 years continuing to work for T’prel, becoming a prime asset for Starfleet Intelligence, building up her own network of informants. During this time, she learned from on of her informants that her Father was killed while on assignment for Starfleet Intelligence. Reeling from this information, she called her mother to subtly ask what her father did for work. Her mother replied that her father worked for Starfleet, but due to the nature of his job, was unable to verify exactly what he did. While she was doing assignments, she kept investigating her father on the side, and eventually discovered that he worked for Section 31, the secretive arm of Starfleet intelligence.One day, T’prel called her into Starfleet HQ to let her know she was going to be transferred to a starship to keep tabs on events unfolding in the Shackleton Expanse, and to listen to the orders of those above her on the ship, but remember where her loyalties lie. Holly was then promoted to Lt Commander, and given orders to travel with all due speed to Narendra Station, and board the USS Nightingale, under the command of Captain Robin Zhao.Value1::\nValue2::\nValue3::\nValue4:: ","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#Characters/PC","#Division/Ops"],"headers":[{"heading":"Summary","level":2,"id":"Summary_0"},{"heading":"Values","level":2,"id":"Values_0"},{"heading":"Relationships","level":2,"id":"Relationships_0"},{"heading":"Player Characters","level":3,"id":"Player_Characters_0"},{"heading":"Supporting Characters","level":3,"id":"Supporting_Characters_0"},{"heading":"Non-Player Characters","level":3,"id":"Non-Player_Characters_0"},{"heading":"Statblock","level":2,"id":"Statblock_0"},{"heading":"Other Portraits","level":2,"id":"Other_Portraits_0"},{"heading":"Logs","level":1,"id":"Logs_0"}],"links":["uss-nightingale.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":".","fullURL":"crew/player-characters/holly-jones.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":["attachments/shackleton-expanse/groups/nightingale/crew/player-characters/holly-jones/img-20250701-pasted-image-20250701082514}.png"],"createdTime":1745744391441,"modifiedTime":1754377206661,"sourceSize":4660,"sourcePath":"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Nightingale/Crew/Player Characters/Holly Jones.md","exportPath":"crew/player-characters/holly-jones.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":6,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"crew/player-characters/janus-lux.html":{"title":"Janus Lux","icon":"","description":"Info\nPronouns:: she/her\nLocation:: Unknown\nNumRank:: 4\nRank:: Lieutenant\nType:: Main Character\nStatus:: Commissioned\nSpecies:: Trill\nRole:: Chief Medical Officer\nPortrait:: <img alt=\"IMG-20250226-Janus Lux}.png\" src=\"attachments/shackleton-expanse/groups/alexandria/characters/alexandria-crew/grace-hopper/img-20250226-janus-lux}.png\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 200px;

She exchanged information for certain assurances, including the protection of her unborn son. Starfleet agreed and set them up in a safehouse: Zefram Cochrane's old Montana ranch, which had since been converted into a cultural center and basic survival training post for Starfleet cadets. Siltec grew up with a love for horses and big open night skies. He would lay on the roof at night and count the stars he would visit when he got to join Starfleet. His mother did not approve, and used her influence to ensure his bid for the academy would not be accepted. But she could stop him from enlisting. She could, however, influence where his first assignment was. Siltec's heart dropped when he opened his duty papers and saw that he was headed right back to the ranch where he grew up, under the watchful eye of his mother.<br>He spent a few years running young Starfleet officers through survival training bootcamp, then watched them leave to follow his dream among the stars.

Her formative years were shaped by the independence and adaptability that life in space required, honing her instincts and skills long before formal training. She finds the gravity on most M class planets to be…weird, and has trouble sleeping without the hum of a starship. <br>At 16, during a trade negotiation mission with her family on Starbase 12, Valera seized a Federation shuttlecraft for a joyride; pushing the shuttle’s limits to evade capture, till she decided she was done and returned the shuttle. Her stunt captured the attention of <a data-href=\"Captain Liu\" href=\"crew/npcs/captain-liu.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Captain Liu</a>. Rather than meting out discipline, Liu recognized her aptitude and saw untapped potential in her. Convincing her that she could fly “further and faster” than ever before, the Liu sponsored her entry into Starfleet Academy, where Valera quickly rose to the top of her class in flight training.<br>When Liu (now Commander) was given a posting on the newly christened <a data-href=\"USS Nightingale\" href=\"uss-nightingale.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">USS Nightingale</a>, Valera (along with fellow mentee <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Kepler Faraday\" data-href=\"Kepler Faraday\" href=\"crew/supporting-characters/kepler-faraday.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Faraday</a>) was brought aboard to serve. When their mentor was given command of his own starship, Valera was offered a transfer and promotion, which she declined in order to stay on the Nightingale. This disappointed Faraday who told her she wasn’t living up to her potential, their friendship has been strained ever since.Cocky and sometimes brash, Valera wields humor as a shield, deflecting her insecurities with a mix of bravado and wit. Her ship and crew, however, have become her anchors, grounding her restless nature in camaraderie. She is a damn good pilot, and truly loves her ship. She’s going to be the greatest pilot Starfleet has ever seen, whatever it takes.Valera is loyal to a fault, and will step in to defend her crew. She doesn’t mind getting into trouble if it’s for “her people.”She sometimes tests the limits of her ship in ways that border on dangerous. She craves the rush of pushing technology—and herself—to the limit. This high tolerance for risk sometimes verges on carelessness, especially in tense or dangerous situations.She deflects emotional or vulnerable moments with humor, making it hard for others to see her true feelings or insecurities.

Yalis was in frequent fights with Klingon children. This led to her interest in under-handed fighting tactics (size and strength don't matter if you poke someone in the eye) and also her determination to always stand up to bullies.\nAs a child, she read a book where humans rode horses, and became determined to ride her pet targ.\nHer childhood fights and attempted targ-riding led to frequent trips to a Klingon doctor, who eventually performed a bone augmentation/strengthening procedure so she wouldn't keep breaking them. <br>She has the typical friendly and open demeanor of a Denobulan. Although she's still fairly new to <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"USS Nightingale\" data-href=\"USS Nightingale\" href=\"uss-nightingale.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">the ship</a> herself, Yalis will look out for new people and try to make them feel welcome.\nYalis has great memory for social interactions. Tell her the name of your dog or kids and she'll remember and ask about them by name when you talk in the future.\nShe does not follow the path of a Klingon warrior, but she does have a strong sense of honor when it comes to honesty and keeping her word.\nShe wants a traditional Denobulan family with many wives and husbands, but her sense of romance is Klingon which has kept her from finding any spouses yet.\nShe has the temper of a Klingon, but she keeps it under such tight wraps that usually only an empath would be able to tell when she's angry. But she survived her childhood by out-Klingoning the Klingon children, and if she perceives someone as a bully they might see a side of her that few people ever meet. <br>Yalis' favorite place on the ship is the <a data-href=\"Crop Sciences Lab\" href=\"ship-locations/crop-sciences-lab.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Crop Sciences Lab</a>. She enjoys being around all the plants. Yalis enjoys the \"seek out new life\" part of the Starfleet mission - she loves first contact, she loves learning about alien cultures and getting to know them, and she loves learning about their technology and biology.\nShe is particularly interested in what digestive systems can tell us about the evolution, culture, and environment of a species, and is delighted if an opportunity arises to acquire a new fecal sample.\nOn her first posting as an Ensign, her ship encountered the Scent-of-Blueberries-and-Ammonia, a non-humanoid species with an olfactory language. Using half-completed designs from her various projects, Yalis was able to create a biochemical/scent-based Universal Translator, leading to a successful first contact.\n<br>Yalis joined the crew of the <a data-href=\"USS Nightingale\" href=\"uss-nightingale.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">USS Nightingale</a> 6 months ago. She liked the idea of being directly involved in helping people while also being close to the frontier where contact with new species was likely.\nValue1:: I have a strong sense of honor when it comes to honesty and keeping my word.\nValue2:: When I see someone in distress, I try to help them.\nValue3:: Creative problem-solving can fix almost anything!\nValue4:: I will always stand up to a bully.\n<br>Yalis and <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Siltec Nol\" data-href=\"Siltec Nol\" href=\"crew/player-characters/siltec-nol.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Siltec</a> share a love of horses.

Not the one you wish you had.This comrade was weird and annoying.I knew as part of the exchange I would need to come equipped with the “open mind” they called it.I am dedicated to my duty. I preserve honor and balance it with life and death. I do this for the patient and for The Empire. But opening this patient’s mind enough to comprehend life and honor was a chore.The patients “empire” has a death wish and the patient didn’t seem to understand if he was alive or dead despite all experience and medical evidence.I am perfectly willing to preserve a patients choice to find an honorable death or seek glory in life. Even if I do not understand their motivation or even believe they will achieve glory. Live and prove me wrong. Thank me later.But how am I supposed to respect your insane death cult if you dont? Convince me you want to die. Convince me you want to live. Choose or the choice is made for you. Meanwhile, despite my efforts to respect and fortify his convictions it seemed like Star Fleet was perfectly happy to talk him in circles until he came around to choosing life. The hypocrisy.I know my people value honor more than most. But I do not think others are without the concept. Still their willingness to risk a life without honor is troubling. If Akarra ever regrets his choice he will have to live his days with the belief that he ruined his people. What kind of life is that to save? Were they really so afraid of death, not even their own death, that they might inflict that fate upon another?The patient gave his support for the Captain’s decision to transport his entire people away from their believed ascension. To accept life. -But not for himself. He considers himself “already dead.” Currently. Maybe. I don't know. His mind is weak. I admit I am relieved at his choice though. Based on the Captain’s actions he would not have allowed Akkara to be transported to his world. Nor would he have listened if Akkara insisted we leave his people to their fate.It would be troublesome to question the Captains authority. I’m sure star fleet has a process for this that would take a million times longer to solve the issue than just killing him would. But even if this were an Empire ship I’m not sure I could have killed him fast enough to belay his order.Either way. The cultists are a fascinating species and culture. Their nanites while not borg are…unusual. I have obtained a sample to study. The officers do not seem concerned, and I am here to learn what they have. This could be quite interesting. Even if the application proves appalling, knowing and understanding it will be of use.As for the patient I have discharged him. He is physically sound and perhaps after bickering with his people his convictions will be as well. &gt; In the meantime I will continue to respect his (philosophical?) belief he is dead. This time, when I hold the tea ceremony he is invited to join. It is not often one can speak to their dead patient. I hope he attends.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#SessionSummary/Logs"],"headers":[],"links":["sessions/summaries/season-2/nightingale-log-11.2-abyss-station.html","crew/player-characters/ujul-asaad.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"sessions/logs/adsog-log.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1754549423559,"modifiedTime":1754549608164,"sourceSize":3332,"sourcePath":"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Nightingale/Sessions/Logs/Adsog Log.md","exportPath":"sessions/logs/adsog-log.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":28,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"sessions/logs/banna-stoker-log-5.2.html":{"title":"Banna Stoker Log 5.2","icon":"","description":"Session:: <a data-href=\"Nightingale Log 5.2 - Complexity\" href=\"sessions/summaries/season-1/nightingale-log-5.2-complexity.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Nightingale Log 5.2 - Complexity</a><br>\nCharacter:: <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Shackleton Expanse/Characters/Season 1/Admiral Banna Stoker\" data-href=\"Shackleton Expanse/Characters/Season 1/Admiral Banna Stoker\" href=\"shackleton-expanse/characters/season-1/admiral-banna-stoker.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Admiral Banna Stoker</a>\nStardate:: 56748Log:: Captain Zhao has ordered the Nightingale to flee from the USS Walcott, leaving her away team on the planet.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#SessionSummary/Logs"],"headers":[],"links":["sessions/summaries/season-1/nightingale-log-5.2-complexity.html","shackleton-expanse/characters/season-1/admiral-banna-stoker.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"sessions/logs/banna-stoker-log-5.2.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1740810451166,"modifiedTime":1740810731838,"sourceSize":342,"sourcePath":"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Nightingale/Sessions/Logs/Banna Stoker Log 5.2.md","exportPath":"sessions/logs/banna-stoker-log-5.2.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":29,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"sessions/logs/janus-lux-log-1.1.html":{"title":"Janus Lux Log 1.1","icon":"","description":"Session:: <a data-href=\"Nightingale Log 1.1 - Bacchus-3\" href=\"sessions/summaries/season-1/nightingale-log-1.1-bacchus-3.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Nightingale Log 1.1 - Bacchus-3</a><br>\nCharacter:: <a data-href=\"Janus Lux\" href=\"crew/player-characters/janus-lux.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Janus Lux</a>\nStardate:: 56241Log:: I convinced the colonists to get medical treatment after I discovered they had kinda wonky Radiation treatment.

Personal report on the rescue mission of Petty Officer Siltec Nol at the Science Conference on Dinasia. Petty Officer Nol had been missing in action since our encounter with the Romulan spy on the USS Hudson. Petty Officer Nol had grabbed the spy as he beamed off, disappearing along with the disguised Romulan. Four days ago, Starfleet Intelligence contacted the USS Nightingale to report that they suspected Petty Officer Nol was being held by the Romulans for his knowledge on a certain Cardassian scientist the Romulans had taken an interest in. Starfleet had arranged, or perhaps merely coopted, a scientific conference on Dinasia where the Romulans were expected to attempt to apprehend the Cardassian scientist. There, our mission was to find Petty Officer Nol or one of the Romulan intelligence agents who was aware of his location. Intelligence sent Commander Jones to assist in coordinating the mission, though as I noted in my formal report, her flagrant disregard of the chain of command and verbal disagreement with nearly every order was the opposite of helpful and significantly impacted our efficiency on this mission.Regardless. On site, several Starfleet officers including Lt. Yalis and Dr. Hernandez from the USS Hudson set up booths to display their scientific work and stay on the lookout for Petty Officer Nol. I kept close to the Cardassians and their booth, and though the Romulans came to view their shoddy work, they did not attempt to glean any significant intel. Misham Nol, Petty Officer Nol’s mother and a member the Obsidian Order, was also present. Fortunately, Ensign Kader was able to telepathically locate Petty Officer Nol, who had been surgically altered to appear as a Romulan attendee. Kader confirmed that Misham Nol was being used as leverage to force Petty Officer Nol to identify the Cardassian scientist. One security officer for the conference was shot, and soon after Ensign Kader foiled an assassination attempt on Misham Nol. Kader acted bravely and was injured in the attempt. I have written a formal recommendation for his promotion for bravery in the field. Security apprehended the assassins, though to avoid a diplomatic incident I told my officers to stand down and let the Romulans, the leaders of this alleged intelligence operation, beam out. Though, not before Lt. Yalis coated them with her science project, a large sample of feces containing a traceable radioactive isotope.Petty Officer Nol is recovering in sickbay after the EMH and Dr. Lux removed his surgical alterations. It is good that the young officer has been returned to the USS Nightingale. We have lost too many already even in the short time of our voyage. However, Petty Officer Nol has proven himself to be a rash and undisciplined officer. When he suspected Admiral Stoker of treachery, rather than confiding in any of his superior officers, he contacted a member of the Obsidian Order, who set a Cardassian mercenary team against the Nightingale. When he is recovered and back on duty, I will address this behavior with him and identify steps to correct it.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#SessionSummary/Logs"],"headers":[],"links":["sessions/summaries/season-1/nightingale-log-10.1-rescue.html","crew/player-characters/vrenta-ewasi.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"sessions/logs/vrenta-log-11.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750571601037,"modifiedTime":1753866469188,"sourceSize":3296,"sourcePath":"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Nightingale/Sessions/Logs/Vrenta Log 11.md","exportPath":"sessions/logs/vrenta-log-11.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":49,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"sessions/logs/yalis-log-1.1.html":{"title":"Yalis Log 1.1","icon":"","description":"Session:: <a data-href=\"Nightingale Log 1.1 - Bacchus-3\" href=\"sessions/summaries/season-1/nightingale-log-1.1-bacchus-3.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Nightingale Log 1.1 - Bacchus-3</a><br>\nCharacter:: <a data-href=\"Yalis\" href=\"crew/player-characters/yalis.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Yalis</a>\nStardate:: 56241Log:: The Nightingale was en route to Bacchus 3 when we were thrown out of warp by subspace waves.The grav plating went offline, and several people (including Chief Bas Sa'mi) were injured. When I arrived in Engineering, I performed first aid on Chief Sa'mi, and he was able to get the warp core back online. I found out from Velara afterwards that we were falling into a sun at the time, but fortunately she was able to get us into a stable orbit once the engines were back online.We continued to Bacchus 3, where we found that the source of the subspace waves was a 10 km tall monolith, part of the ancient ruins on the planet's surface. The monolith was covered in runes in an unknown language.We landed and spoke to the colonists, who had glowing blue patches under their skin and appeared to be entranced by the monolith. They said they were trying to figure it out. They had a subspace relay activated and pointed towards the monolith, but it was not what was causing the monolith to produce the waves. Velara found readings of a power source similar to a warp core in the planet's core.There were two Klingons on the surface, who had arrived ahead of their ship. Their Bird of Prey was knocked out of warp shortly after the away team arrived on the surface, and the Nightingale tractored the Klingon ship out of danger.Lt. Gray and Siltec attempted to convince the colonists to come to our ship with us, and eventually persuaded them to accept treatment for radiation exposure. Janus included a sedative in the treatment administered, making it easier to herd the colonists.One Vulcan colonist was attempting to decipher the runes and was particularly resistant to stopping his work and going with Siltec - I offered to continue his work for him. He pointed out two runes of particular interest likely to be related to other languages in this region of space.

I was able to interpret some of the runes on the monolith and discovered one of them identified a button for opening the monolith.A Klingon shuttle was approaching, but turned back when Janus and I informed them the planet was under quarantine. The colonists on the ship were also placed in quarantine by the EMH.While we were dealing with that, Siltec went to look for the rest of the colonists. He didn't find them, but he took his shoes off for some reason and contact with the planet made his feet get glowy/blue and start phasing into subspace. (We also found out that colonists who were blue had stopped showing up/disappeared, and were concerned this would happen to Siltec's feet.)I used the colonists' dish to transmit an inverse wave at Siltec's feet and restore them to normal space. When the team on the ship returned, I asked them to bring a metal tape measure, and built a yagi that can act as a portable de-bluer. I also informed the EMH and Chief Sa'mi of the solution I had discovered.The Klingon shuttle went to the Nightingale, where Gray and Velara talked to them. They did a very good job convincing the Klingons to cooperate with our handling of the situation, and earned the respect of the Klingons (when Commander Gluk was rude, Velara said she didn't know they let targs command ships). They didn't seem too concerned about D'Loq and Brutog (the two Klingon colonists in sickbay), they were just upset that their ship had been knocked out of warp.When Gray and Velara came back to the surface, we opened the monolith. Janus was under the influence of the monolith and tried to run inside, but Siltec stopped her and I de-blued her. Her medical tricorder was thrown in and hit by a defensive beam.

Cmdr. Rennan Kader.We delivered presents (mostly weapons, also targs) to Klingon children on several colony planets along the border for the Klingon holiday of Tor'Gos.At the first planet we visited (Khitomer), we had to go down in a shuttle because the transporter couldn't reach some of the houses. Klingon children fired surface to air missiles at our shuttle, and we discovered it is customary for Klingon children to attack Klingon Santa (who was named Gar'Nash at first but later mutated to Gash'Nar). We retaliated by beaming balloons full of targ manure over their heads. (Balloons were produced by Rennan and Yalis wrestling a targ and giving it a laxative, then collecting the result.)At the second planet we visited (Beta Thoridor) there was subspace-related lightening in the atmosphere, and Valera was able to fly us under it. We completed that delivery pretty quickly. We also discovered there was a pathogen in the targ manure that made our skin emit a pheromone that smelled delicious to some predator animals, but fortunately Rennan was able to program the transporters to eliminate it (assisted by Bas Sa'mi).The third planet we visited (H'atoria) seemed uneventful until several Klingon children beamed aboard the ship and attacked Rennan in sickbay. He eventually got them to go out into the hallway by telepathically projecting the voice of Gash'Nar into their heads taunting them about looking in the wrong place. We then distracted them with a holographic Gash'Nar in the hallway, which kept them busy fighting until they could be beamed back to their homes.The fourth planet we visited (Gamma Eridon) was on the Klingon-Romulan border and had colonists of both species on the planet. Three Romulan ships were on the planet and tried to stop us from \"delivering weapons to the planet\". We attempted to explain to the Romulans that they were \"childrens' weapons\" and demonstrated the use of a targ poop balloon (Rennan threw it an Yalis), but the Romulans weren't convinced. We beamed targs onto the Romulan ships to keep them distracted while we made our deliveries, and then some clever flying by Valera (plus a targ chewing something near a Romulan warp core - thanks Kamin!) got us out of there without the Romulans being able to follow.The last planet we visited was Narendra, an important planet in the history of Klingon-Federation relations (this is where Captain Garret of the Enterprise-C made her heroic sacrifice to save Klingons from a Romulan sneak attack). Tor'Gos celebrations on this world typically involve a federation ship flying over the planet and detonating in the sky to commemorate the occasion. We decided that we would do something to the warp drive of a shuttle to make it able to sky-write Qapla' in glowing letters over the planet, then blow it up. Valera decided to fly the shuttle herself instead of having it on auto-pilot, but it didn't go well and she knocked the head off the statue of Captain Garret. Yalis was supposed to beam her out before the shuttle exploded, but our timing was off and Yalis beamed her out while the shuttle was exploding. Fortunately Rennan was able to heroically pull her back from the brink of death and she survived.Throughout the mission, Valera pushed the engines to their limits and got us places quickly. We made all of our deliveries.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#SessionSummary/Logs"],"headers":[],"links":["sessions/summaries/season-1/nightingale-log-2-a-klingon-christmas.html","crew/player-characters/yalis.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"sessions/logs/yalis-log-2.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1739702729506,"modifiedTime":1739702804963,"sourceSize":3604,"sourcePath":"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Nightingale/Sessions/Logs/Yalis Log 2.md","exportPath":"sessions/logs/yalis-log-2.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":53,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"sessions/logs/yalis-log-3.1.html":{"title":"Yalis Log 3.1","icon":"","description":"Session:: <a data-href=\"Nightingale Log 3.1 - Orion Heist\" href=\"sessions/summaries/season-1/nightingale-log-3.1-orion-heist.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Nightingale Log 3.1 - Orion Heist</a><br>\nCharacter:: <a data-href=\"Yalis\" href=\"crew/player-characters/yalis.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Yalis</a>\nStardate:: 57005Log:: The Nightingale went to Starbase 364 (Narendra station, a base jointly run with the Klingons, primarily a research station), to unload the ancient Tikatal from our pattern buffer.Siltec, Relza, and Yalis sparred in the holodeck. Yalis swung around on the stalactites and shined light in Siltec's eyes to blind him. Siltec threw Relza at her. Siltec thought he had won, but since his phaser was pointed at Relza (who was on Yalis), Yalis grabbed Siltec's ankle to pull him to the ground, then took his hat hostage to win the sparring.Vrenta Awasi and Admiral Stoker met us at the doors to the holodeck with a mission, and gave us a data PADD with information about an artifact recently stolen from the station. The block looked like sandstone, was a few feet in size was gem-shaped like a mini-monolith, and had runes on it like we had encountered at Baccus 3. The artifact was found on the nearby planet Dinassia 2. It was scanned before the theft - no energy emissions, but it had certain alloys under the surface (they couldn't scan much deeper). It was stolen 2 days ago, after the Nightingale had deactivated the Baccus 3 monolith.We checked out the archive it was stolen from - someone had entered without using the door, and we found a transporter signature consistent with Orien transporters. There was only one Orien ship in the area recently, the SS Castlerock, a freighter/merchant ship under the command of Captain Peljara. We told Admiral Stoker what we found, then took the runabout the McKenzie to go after them.We caught up with the McKenzie near the edge of the Romulan neutral zone. Subspace waves were present, and Yalis applied the debluer modifications to the runabout's deflector to create subspace shielding.Velara told them they had forgotten to pay the \"neutral zone identification fee\" (implying an Orien bribe), and they agreed to let us onboard. Before we came onboard, the back end of the Casterock appeared to be crushed like a can, there was a containment breach, and things started to float out but were then pulled back in.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#SessionSummary/Logs"],"headers":[],"links":["sessions/summaries/season-1/nightingale-log-3.1-orion-heist.html","crew/player-characters/yalis.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"sessions/logs/yalis-log-3.1.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1739702838176,"modifiedTime":1739702903723,"sourceSize":2256,"sourcePath":"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Nightingale/Sessions/Logs/Yalis Log 3.1.md","exportPath":"sessions/logs/yalis-log-3.1.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":54,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"sessions/logs/yalis-log-3.2.html":{"title":"Yalis Log 3.2","icon":"","description":"Session:: <a data-href=\"Nightingale Log 3.2 - Orion Heist\" href=\"sessions/summaries/season-1/nightingale-log-3.2-orion-heist.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Nightingale Log 3.2 - Orion Heist</a><br>\nCharacter:: <a data-href=\"Yalis\" href=\"crew/player-characters/yalis.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Yalis</a>\nStardate:: 57019Log:: Stolen artifact may be some kind of controller for monolithsWe were on the runabout MacKenzie, chasing the Orien ship SS CastlerockAway team went to Castlerock, Artax stayed with shuttle.

By night she analyzes stool samples to see how the superfoods are affecting the gut microbiome.Radix Bina (she) is a joined trill, lead crop scientist from the planet.

(I'm naming the kid Brom.) Gray also had an allergic reaction and went to sickbay.Velara (who also ate a berry) didn't have an allergic reaction but noticed how nice Janus' spots were. Janus put the crop lab on lockdown when she first had a reaction.Much horniness ensued, with people who hadn't eaten berries becoming wildly attracted to adults who had (or developing strong protective/parenting instincts towards kids who had).Yalis' girlfriend Relza went off with Gray (who had eaten a berry), but he avoided sleeping with her and just led her back to sickbay.Janus and Velara were very, very into each-other in sickbay. Siltec and the Vulcan went off together. Yalis became extremely protective of the kids, and alternated between trying to find a cure and encouraging the children to observe the fascinating display of mating behaviors.It turned out that when separated from their native soil the ice peas made a protein that caused all of this. The captain was eating a bowl of the peas and watching a movie. We eventually released an aerosolized cure in the ship's ventilation systems. Janus and Velara had a difficult time with this because they didn't want to stop feeling what they felt for each-other, but eventually managed to put the ship and crew first.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#SessionSummary/Logs"],"headers":[],"links":["sessions/summaries/season-1/nightingale-log-4-peas-to-meet-you.html","crew/player-characters/yalis.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"sessions/logs/yalis-log-4.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1739703040210,"modifiedTime":1739703122280,"sourceSize":2530,"sourcePath":"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Nightingale/Sessions/Logs/Yalis Log 4.md","exportPath":"sessions/logs/yalis-log-4.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":56,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"sessions/logs/zephyr-grey-log-1.1.html":{"title":"Zephyr Grey Log 1.1","icon":"","description":"Session:: <a data-href=\"Nightingale Log 1.1 - Bacchus-3\" href=\"sessions/summaries/season-1/nightingale-log-1.1-bacchus-3.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Nightingale Log 1.1 - Bacchus-3</a><br>\nCharacter:: <a data-href=\"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Nightingale/Crew/Player Characters/Zephyr Grey\" href=\"crew/player-characters/zephyr-grey.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Nightingale/Crew/Player Characters/Zephyr Grey</a>\nStardate:: 56241Log:: The USS Nightingale lost power due to a subspace gravitational wave while in transit to Bacchus-3.

Stoker resigned her commission shortly after the trial.Aram played Loxor the Ferengi prosecutor (non-Starfleet, most of Starfleet didn't want to touch the trial) and a guest star played Captain Ojok Tokmoth the Klingon defense lawyer Additional details learned during session:\nStoker was a Rear Admiral\nThe other Admiral in charge of Narendra Station was Admiral Opok Krakt (she/her), it's a joint Federation/Klingon operation\nAfter stealing artifact, Stoker was on another ship exploring planets, encountered trouble, fled to Nightinggale while being chased by USS Walcott\nThe artifact was stored in a special Starfleet box for safety until incident with Orions, only recently been out to be studied.\nThe judge was Admiral Jackson Nolan (human, he/him).Before trial, Stoker was talking to Tokmoth in a secure area/meeting room for privacy. Explains attourney/client privilege, Stoker doubts them, Tokmoth invokes Klingon honor, Stoker says not like she has a choice anyway. Tokmoth says Stoker has right to challenge them to a duel if defense not good.Opening arguments: Loxor opening argument was centered on General Orders 17 and 29 about not unnecessarily endangering Starfleet personnel or the Federation. Tokmoth opening argument is that it's our duty to explore but that we don't control what we find (invoked Prime Directive as an example) and that it's important fill in gaps with assumptions. Tokmoth says duty is to explore single question - did admiral stoker display both intent and ability to carry out crimes accused of.Review of facts, then lunch. Loxor interviewed Lt. Relza, who was against Stoker and saw no medical evidence for influence. Tokmoth talked further with Admiral Stoker, found out she considered herself a whistle-blower and that the Federation were exploiting the Tilikaal for their technology.Captain Zhao took the stand, asked questions by both sides. Loxor tried to build a case that the Tilikaal are an existential threat to the Federation. Tokmoth tried to build a case that it was Starfleet's duty to interact diplomatically with a species asking for help and that hostility and motivations can be difficult to interpret in unfamiliar cultures.Tokmoth spoke to Lt. Yalis, Yalis explained that Admiral doesn't have an ancient Tilikaal in her but does Yalis said Admiral used to be more cautious and that behavior changed after contact with artifact. Yalis also thinks Lt. Gray might have been mind-controlled into his stunt with the transporters and the ghosts.An initial interaction between Tokmoth and Algan Kader happened, can't remember if it was on the stand or asking questions. (Forgot to take notes during this part, HELP does anyone have details?)Out of courtroom, Yalis investigated artifact. Found it was broadcasting a wide/untargeted subspace signal that was probably a distress call. Also used a medical testing hologram to discover that it could have subtle effects on the brain that might affect thoughts/behavior. Yalis told Tokmoth about this. Got permission to use scanner on Admiral Stoker, Admiral Stoker's brain showed effects.Admiral Stoker took the stand, questioned by both Loxor first. If free and given a ship, she would go to a facility the Tilikaal told her about. Tried to establish a case that Stoker was serving the Tilikaal. Then Tokmoth asked questions - Admiral does not believe what she wants to do would endanger the Federation.During Admiral Stoker's questions with Tokmoth, Algan Kader noticed thoughts in the room. Admiral Krakt was angry the court martial was questioning her friend Admiral Stoker's honor. Admiral Nolan (the judge) was thinking lyrics to \"Twinkle twinkle little star\" to block mind-reading, on closer look Kader heard him think \"I have to convict her and remove her from the picture\" (referring to Admiral Stoker).Ensign Kader told Yalis he needed a disturbance so he could talk to Tokmoth. Yalis started some dyke drama with Relza and it escalated into punching, arrested, session went to recess. Kader told Tokmoth about what he heard in the judge's thoughts.When court reconvened, Tokmoth called Kader to the stand, and had him reveal what he had heard in the judge's thoughts. Admiral Krakt had Klingon security on the station arrest the judge, and a mistrial was declared.After the trial, Admiral Stoker resigned her commission, is now a civilian. Loxor and Tokmoth talked after court, acknowledged each-other as worthy adversaries, might even work together in the future. Tokmoth also talked to Ensign Kader and commended his bravery in coming forward and said helping cowards find their bravery to create a more honorable galaxy is why they became a lawyer.If Yalis is charged for the punch-up in the courtroom, Tokmoth will defend her.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#SessionSummary/Session"],"headers":[{"heading":"Session Summary","level":1,"id":"Session_Summary_0"},{"heading":"Summary","level":2,"id":"Summary_0"},{"heading":"Detailed Recap","level":2,"id":"Detailed_Recap_0"},{"heading":"Logs","level":2,"id":"Logs_0"}],"links":["shackleton-expanse/missions/season-1/order-in-court.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"sessions/summaries/season-1/nightingale-log-9-order-in-court.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1745745141252,"modifiedTime":1754549371873,"sourceSize":5875,"sourcePath":"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Nightingale/Sessions/Summaries/Season 1/Nightingale Log 9 - Order in Court.md","exportPath":"sessions/summaries/season-1/nightingale-log-9-order-in-court.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":77,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"sessions/summaries/season-1/nightingale-log-10.1-rescue.html":{"title":"Nightingale Log 10.1 - Rescue","icon":"","description":"Stardate:: 57017\nMission:: <a data-href=\"Convention\" href=\"shackleton-expanse/missions/season-1/convention.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Convention</a>\nNote:: Starfleet Intelligence sources believed Siltec to be in custody of the Romulans as they attempted to learn more about the Cardassian Disruptor Spinal Lance technology.

The crew of the Nightingale was brought in to display their findings from research in the Shackleton Expanse.During the convention, Siltec was disguised as a Romulan and told to identify Cardassian engineers who worked on the Spinal Lance.

Siltec's handler, Sub-Commander Thal'vaek threatened to kill her if he did not cooperate.Ensign Algan quickly identified Siltec telepathically, and notified the crew and Starfleet Intelligence.

The people living on the orbiting planet awaited their ascension, believing they were in no danger. Meanwhile, an away team entered a Tilikaal space station to find the Romulans in the control room.The Nightingale was sent on a mission to the Omega Draconis system to find out what the Romulans were doing there. There, a single planet and a Neutronium space station orbiting a black hole. The black hole itself began rotating, so that it's radiation jets were aligned with the galactic plane. This threatened to utterly destroy the planet, but also throw radiation up to 100 light years away.On the planet, a landing party found a small colony of less than 1000 people called the Ithik worshiping the black hole. They seemed excited to finally have the Abyss gaze back at them, after they had observed it for thousands of years. The landing party made some attempts to explain that the black hole would obliterate them, but the Ithik remained convinced they would ascend to a high form of existence when the truth of the universe is revealed to them through the black hole.The Ithik had with them a single artifact from the Tilikaal, similar to the artifact that Banna Stoker used. Commander Vrenta used the artifact to recieve a vision of the Neutronium space station. The landing party then took the artifact, beamed onto a shuttle, and went straight to the space station with only 2 hours until Chaktir would be destroyed.Siltec used the artifact as a key to enter the station. Inside, they found a small Romulan scout ship in a docking bay. Siltec was able to pick up trace heat signatures left over from when the Romulans passed by. The away team split up into two teams. Siltec and Vrenta found large security robots lined with Neutronium plugged into stations along the walls. Holly Jones and Ujul Atsad found a cloning facility and released a person who claimed to be Akkara, the \"mayor\" of Chaktir. They were confused about how they got there but remembered being visited by Tilikaal on Chaktir.Vrenta and Siltec were able to finally locate the station's control room, and sent directions to Cmdr.

The crew of the Nightingale was brought in to display their findings from research in the Shackleton Expanse.During the convention, Siltec was disguised as a Romulan and told to identify Cardassian engineers who worked on the Spinal Lance. Though reluctant to comply, Siltec's mother, Misham Nol, was conspicuously present at the convention. Siltec's handler, Sub-Commander Thal'vaek threatened to kill her if he did not cooperate.Ensign Algan quickly identified Siltec telepathically, and notified the crew and Starfleet Intelligence.

The people living on the orbiting planet awaited their ascension, believing they were in no danger. Meanwhile, an away team entered a Tilikaal space station to find the Romulans in the control room.The Nightingale was sent on a mission to the Omega Draconis system to find out what the Romulans were doing there. There, a single planet and a Neutronium space station orbiting a black hole. The black hole itself began rotating, so that it's radiation jets were aligned with the galactic plane. This threatened to utterly destroy the planet, but also throw radiation up to 100 light years away.On the planet, a landing party found a small colony of less than 1000 people called the Ithik worshiping the black hole. They seemed excited to finally have the Abyss gaze back at them, after they had observed it for thousands of years. The landing party made some attempts to explain that the black hole would obliterate them, but the Ithik remained convinced they would ascend to a high form of existence when the truth of the universe is revealed to them through the black hole.The Ithik had with them a single artifact from the Tilikaal, similar to the artifact that Banna Stoker used. Commander Vrenta used the artifact to recieve a vision of the Neutronium space station. The landing party then took the artifact, beamed onto a shuttle, and went straight to the space station with only 2 hours until Chaktir would be destroyed.Siltec used the artifact as a key to enter the station. Inside, they found a small Romulan scout ship in a docking bay. Siltec was able to pick up trace heat signatures left over from when the Romulans passed by. The away team split up into two teams. Siltec and Vrenta found large security robots lined with Neutronium plugged into stations along the walls. Holly Jones and Ujul Atsad found a cloning facility and released a person who claimed to be Akkara, the \"mayor\" of Chaktir. They were confused about how they got there but remembered being visited by Tilikaal on Chaktir.Vrenta and Siltec were able to finally locate the station's control room, and sent directions to Cmdr.

Senior officer T’Vel agreed first and the others followed. Thal’vaek called them traitors.With the Romulans’ help, the team began to reorient the black hole’s jets and prepare to destroy the station before it could fall into the wrong hands. Rala and Vrenta worked at the main control consoles. Holly Jones and a Romulan went missing while allegedly seeking the engine room.Siltec continued reasoning with Thal’vaek, revealing details about his own family’s sacrifice.

A monument from their observatory in the form of a telescope was also beamed aboard.Merdeck and Thal’vaek were placed in the brig.\n<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Nightingale/Sessions/Summaries/Season 2/Nightingale Log 12 - Finding Faith.md\" data-href=\"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Nightingale/Sessions/Summaries/Season 2/Nightingale Log 12 - Finding Faith.md\" href=\"sessions/summaries/season-2/nightingale-log-12-finding-faith.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Nightingale Log 12 - Finding Faith</a>: Stardate 59279Tensions with the evacuated Ithik escalated as Mayor Akkara accused Starfleet of violating their faith. Akkara's clone, avoided contact with his people, but was eventually persuaded to reach out to them, causing division amongst them. The crew eased tension by constructing a religious space for them aboard the ship, and started planning an asteroid relocation to construct a new home.The USS Nightingale departed Chaktir carrying the evacuated Ithik and the clone known as “Ourkkara,” who had been in stasis for thousands of years. Tensions rose when Mayor Akkara accused Starfleet of kidnapping his people and Ourkkara avoided speaking with them.Vrenta and Rala tried to calm the Ithik, but Mayor Akkara resisted, viewing Starfleet’s actions as a violation of their faith. Meanwhile, Rala discovered that Ministers Vodlin and Naklep could no longer hear the harmonic pitch they once associated with the black hole, gifting them a tuning fork to aid in regaining the sound.The crew met with Captain Zhao and decided to build an Ithik religious space aboard the ship, including a nanite-filled sensory deprivation pool and sound-isolated walls. Rala proposed a feasibility study for towing an asteroid into orbit around the black hole to provide the Ithik a new home, successfully simulating its viability.Holly revealed a distorted recording of Lt. Grey, thought lost near Ithik space, but was confined to quarters after clashing with Zhao over her unauthorized use of lethal force.Conflict escalated when Mayor Akkara accused Ourkkara of being a spy and attempted to stab him. Akkara's helmet broke and it revealed he was identical to Ourkkara in every way.Rala used her asteroid simulation and the possibility of aid from the Wandering Kindred of the Song to win over key ministers, easing tensions in the cargo bay. By the session’s end, the Ithik accepted the newly built religious room aboard the Nightingale, giving the crew a path toward reconciliation and future cooperation.\n<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Nightingale/Sessions/Summaries/Season 2/Nightingale Log 13.1 Crystal Clear.md\" data-href=\"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Nightingale/Sessions/Summaries/Season 2/Nightingale Log 13.1 Crystal Clear.md\" href=\"sessions/summaries/season-2/nightingale-log-13.1-crystal-clear.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Nightingale Log 13.1 Crystal Clear</a>: Stardate 59317The Nightingale investigated a mysterious crystalline vessel near Narendra Station, discovering hundreds of non-organic sentiences within and a lodged titanium torpedo. Attempts to communicate failed as the ship began discharging energy, and Siltec and Rala pushed through heavy fire to secure the torpedo. When it was transported out, it exploded, leaving both officers critically injured and breaching the vessel’s hull.The USS Nightingale returned to Narendra Station, where the crew prepared for a new mission. While onboarding new officers, Vrenta learned that Terzin Lux carried Janus’ symbiont and realized Janus had died. Preparations were interrupted when sensors detected an unidentified object approaching the station at warp speed. Its unusual readings suggested neither conventional propulsion nor cloaking, prompting General Kargan to call for its destruction. Vrenta refused, earning Kargon’s respect by instead arranging a blockade and leading the Nightingale to investigate.Upon approach, the object revealed itself as a massive crystalline vessel. Rala sensed faint telepathic activity, but communication failed, and scans showed hundreds of non-organic sentiences within its structure. Zephyr Industries claimed salvage rights and attempted to dissipate the vessel’s warp bubble, but the Nightingale convinced them to wait while the crew beamed aboard to investigate. Inside, they detected a titanium torpedo lodged within the crystalline walls and encountered a labyrinthine interior filled with both vacuum pockets and liquid-filled chambers.The crystals suddenly discharged energy against nearby ships, striking the Nightingale and Zephyr vessels. Terzin attempted to interact with the walls but was injured, while his phaser fire was mirrored back by the crystalline structures, suggesting the energy discharges might be a form of communication rather than hostility. As the away team navigated deeper, Siltec and Rala rushed toward the torpedo under heavy fire. Siltec managed to tag the device for transport, but when the Nightingale beamed it away, it detonated. The explosion left Siltec and Rala unconscious with critical injuries and blew a hole in the crystalline hull.\n<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Nightingale/Sessions/Summaries/Season 2/Nightingale Log 13.2 - Shattered Relationships.md\" data-href=\"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Nightingale/Sessions/Summaries/Season 2/Nightingale Log 13.2 - Shattered Relationships.md\" href=\"sessions/summaries/season-2/nightingale-log-13.2-shattered-relationships.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Nightingale Log 13.2 - Shattered Relationships</a>: Stardate 59317- The Nightingale is equipped with dozens of shuttles.
