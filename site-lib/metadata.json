Her father was away for work most of her life, and she didn’t really know why. After she graduated from Admiral Kathryn Janeway Highschool, she joined Starfleet Academy on a Security track. During her time in the academy, she received word that her father had been killed, and she thought about quitting, but decided to continue on in his memory. After she graduated, she was assigned to the USS Firebrand, a Freedom Class ship as a Security officer. During her time on the Firebrand, she developed the skills required to be a Combat Medic by working closely with the ships doctor.About a year after joining her crew, they were patrolling near Wolf-359, when they received a hail from the USS Melbourne that the Borg had been sighted. Rushing to her aid, they watched in horror as the Borg destroyed the Melbourne. During the Battle, the Firebrand was critically damaged, and the Captain ordered the full evacuation of the crew. On her way to the escape pods, she watched a bulkhead blow infront of her, and suck out everyone into space before a force field sprang up, saving her life. Only her and the XO, Cmdr T’prel, survived. They spent 3 days floating in the debris field of the battle, not knowing if, or when, they would be rescued.After being rescued, the two were returned to Earth for debriefing, and Holly wanted to resign her commission, but Commander T’prel convinced her that that would be an insult to the memory of the crew they lost. She was promoted to a Full Lieutenant, and assigned to the USS Fresno, a California Class ship, and placed in charge of the security department. She spent the next 4 years of her life on the Fresno, before she requested some shore leave for the Anniversary of Wolf 359.Holly traveled back to Earth to meet up with Commander T’prel, who had recently been promoted to Captain. Captain T’prel informed her that she was now working with Starfleet Inelegance, and that she wanted Holly to join her, so they could work to stop another event like Wolf 359 before it even happened. What was supposed to be a quick weekend trip to remember fallen friends and crew, turned into a shift in her career. Now officially working for Intelligence, she was sent on an assignment to gather information about a new cell of the Maquis operating out of The Badlands. While investigating, she stumbled upon a small craft trying to smuggle goods off of Bajor, and was able to apprehend the pilot. Turning him over to Starfleet, she was able to ascertain where the goods were being smuggled to, and transferred the intelligence to T’prel.She then spent the next 7 years continuing to work for T’prel, becoming a prime asset for Starfleet Intelligence, building up her own network of informants. During this time, she learned from on of her informants that her Father was killed while on assignment for Starfleet Intelligence. Reeling from this information, she called her mother to subtly ask what her father did for work. Her mother replied that her father worked for Starfleet, but due to the nature of his job, was unable to verify exactly what he did. While she was doing assignments, she kept investigating her father on the side, and eventually discovered that he worked for Section 31, the secretive arm of Starfleet intelligence.One day, T’prel called her into Starfleet HQ to let her know she was going to be transferred to a starship to keep tabs on events unfolding in the Shackleton Expanse, and to listen to the orders of those above her on the ship, but remember where her loyalties lie. Holly was then promoted to Lt Commander, and given orders to travel with all due speed to Narendra Station, and board the USS Nightingale, under the command of Captain Robin Zhao.Table6 resultsSort1Filter1PropertiesNewFjFjFjFjFj","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#Characters/PC","#Division/Ops"],"headers":[{"heading":"Summary","level":2,"id":"Summary_0"},{"heading":"Missions","level":1,"id":"Missions_0"},{"heading":"Other Portraits","level":2,"id":"Other_Portraits_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":".","fullURL":"crew/holly-jones.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":["attachments/shackleton-expanse/groups/nightingale/crew/holly-jones/img-20250926-pasted-image-20250701082514}.png"],"createdTime":1757603434638,"modifiedTime":1760086026041,"sourceSize":4940,"sourcePath":"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Nightingale/Crew/Holly Jones.md","exportPath":"crew/holly-jones.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":7,"backlinks":["sessions/summaries/season-1/nightingale-log-10.1-rescue.html","sessions/summaries/season-2/nightingale-log-11.1-looking-into-the-abyss.html","sessions/summaries/season-2/nightingale-log-11.2-abyss-station.html","sessions/summaries/season-2/nightingale-log-12-finding-faith.html","sessions/summaries/season-2/nightingale-log-14.1-pasqual's-progress.html","sessions/summaries/season-2/nightingale-log-14.2-assimilation.html"],"type":"markdown"},"crew/jackson-hayes.html":{"title":"Jackson Hayes","icon":"","description":"Info\nPronouns: he/him\nRank: Lieutenant JG\nSpecies: Human\nRole: Flight Controller\nPortrait:: <img alt=\"IMG-20250926-download20241104195325}.png\" src=\"attachments/shackleton-expanse/groups/nightingale/crew/jackson-hayes/img-20250926-download20241104195325}.png\" target=\"_self\">\nNote: Ambitious and gunning for a command of his own.\nTable0 resultsSort1Filter1PropertiesNew","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#Rank/Commissioned","#Characters/NPC","#Division/Command"],"headers":[{"heading":"Summary","level":2,"id":"Summary_0"},{"heading":"Missions","level":1,"id":"Missions_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":".","fullURL":"crew/jackson-hayes.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":["attachments/shackleton-expanse/groups/nightingale/crew/jackson-hayes/img-20250926-download20241104195325}.png"],"createdTime":1757603434690,"modifiedTime":1760093504904,"sourceSize":1052,"sourcePath":"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Nightingale/Crew/Jackson Hayes.md","exportPath":"crew/jackson-hayes.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":8,"backlinks":["crew/robin-zhao.html","crew/valera.html","crew/zephyr-grey.html"],"type":"markdown"},"crew/janus-lux.html":{"title":"Janus Lux","icon":"","description":"Info\nPronouns: she/her\nRank: Lieutenant JG\nSpecies: Trill\nRole: Chief Medical Officer\nPortrait:: <img alt=\"IMG-20250926-Janus Lux}.png\" src=\"attachments/shackleton-expanse/groups/nightingale/crew/janus-lux/img-20250926-janus-lux}.png\" target=\"_self\">\nNote: Working in a position far above her rank and in over her head.\nValue1:: Listen to the patient;

She exchanged information for certain assurances, including the protection of her unborn son. Starfleet agreed and set them up in a safehouse: Zefram Cochrane's old Montana ranch, which had since been converted into a cultural center and basic survival training post for Starfleet cadets. Siltec grew up with a love for horses and big open night skies. He would lay on the roof at night and count the stars he would visit when he got to join Starfleet. His mother did not approve, and used her influence to ensure his bid for the academy would not be accepted. But she could stop him from enlisting. She could, however, influence where his first assignment was. Siltec's heart dropped when he opened his duty papers and saw that he was headed right back to the ranch where he grew up, under the watchful eye of his mother.<br>He spent a few years running young Starfleet officers through survival training bootcamp, then watched them leave to follow his dream among the stars.

Starfleet gets two things from this deal:\nSiltec is a good agent.\nOnce his mom got him back in the nest, she wasn't nearly as forthcoming with information, so Starfleet sees this as a way to use her son's safety (and constant updates on his whereabouts and actions) as a negotiating tool. <br>Siltec only had one request: a billet aboard the <a data-href=\"USS Nightingale\" href=\"uss-nightingale.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">USS Nightingale</a> and a path to adventure.Value1:: Trust, but verify\nValue2:: The front line is a privilege\nValue3:: I am willing to sacrifice myself for my crewmates\nValue4:: Fear no evil\n<br>Both <a data-href=\"Yalis\" href=\"crew/yalis.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Yalis</a> and Siltec have a deep love of husbandry and horses.\n<br>Siltec and <a data-href=\"Valera\" href=\"crew/valera.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Valera</a> have a friendship forged by their shared experience of being seen as Starfleet's \"bad guys\" <br>Siltec reports directly to <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Artax\" data-href=\"Artax\" href=\"crew/artax.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Chief Petty Officer Artax</a>, <br><a data-href=\"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Nightingale/Crew/Vrenta Ewasi\" href=\"crew/vrenta-ewasi.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Nightingale/Crew/Vrenta Ewasi</a> is a Bajoran, and has a deep rooted suspicion of Siltec.

Her formative years were shaped by the independence and adaptability that life in space required, honing her instincts and skills long before formal training. She finds the gravity on most M class planets to be…weird, and has trouble sleeping without the hum of a starship. <br>At 16, during a trade negotiation mission with her family on Starbase 12, Valera seized a Federation shuttlecraft for a joyride; pushing the shuttle’s limits to evade capture, till she decided she was done and returned the shuttle. Her stunt captured the attention of <a data-href=\"Captain Liu\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Captain Liu</a>.

When their mentor was given command of his own starship, Valera was offered a transfer and promotion, which she declined in order to stay on the Nightingale. This disappointed Faraday who told her she wasn’t living up to her potential, their friendship has been strained ever since.Cocky and sometimes brash, Valera wields humor as a shield, deflecting her insecurities with a mix of bravado and wit. Her ship and crew, however, have become her anchors, grounding her restless nature in camaraderie. She is a damn good pilot, and truly loves her ship. She’s going to be the greatest pilot Starfleet has ever seen, whatever it takes.Valera is loyal to a fault, and will step in to defend her crew. She doesn’t mind getting into trouble if it’s for “her people.”She sometimes tests the limits of her ship in ways that border on dangerous. She craves the rush of pushing technology—and herself—to the limit. This high tolerance for risk sometimes verges on carelessness, especially in tense or dangerous situations.She deflects emotional or vulnerable moments with humor, making it hard for others to see her true feelings or insecurities. Her humor can distance her from forming deeper relationships.Valera respects competence over rank.For Valera, the Nightingale isn’t just an assignment—it’s her family, a place she feels understood and needed in ways few can match.Value1:: No Home but the Stars\nValue2:: Push the Limit, Find the Balance\nValue3:: I am the Helm\nValue4:: There’s Always a Way\n<br>Both Velara and <a data-href=\"Zephyr Grey\" href=\"crew/zephyr-grey.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Zephyr Grey</a> grew up on the go and share a familiarity with being in space more-so than the ground.\n<br>Velara and <a data-href=\"Siltec Nol\" href=\"crew/siltec-nol.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Siltec Nol</a> have a friendship forged in a common experience of being Starfleet ‘bad guys’ and occasionally getting shit for that. <br>Velara has gotten quite close with <a data-href=\"Jackson Hayes\" href=\"crew/jackson-hayes.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Jackson Hayes</a> due to their shared experiences with <a data-href=\"Orion\" href=\"shackleton-expanse/locations/systems-and-planets/orion.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Orion</a> diplomacy. <a data-href=\"Jackson Hayes\" href=\"crew/jackson-hayes.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Jackson Hayes</a> is a bit of a diplomatic brat and had seen his parents deal with Orions before.

Yalis was in frequent fights with Klingon children. This led to her interest in under-handed fighting tactics (size and strength don't matter if you poke someone in the eye) and also her determination to always stand up to bullies.\nAs a child, she read a book where humans rode horses, and became determined to ride her pet targ.\nHer childhood fights and attempted targ-riding led to frequent trips to a Klingon doctor, who eventually performed a bone augmentation/strengthening procedure so she wouldn't keep breaking them. <br>She has the typical friendly and open demeanor of a Denobulan. Although she's still fairly new to <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"USS Nightingale\" data-href=\"USS Nightingale\" href=\"uss-nightingale.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">the ship</a> herself, Yalis will look out for new people and try to make them feel welcome.\nYalis has great memory for social interactions. Tell her the name of your dog or kids and she'll remember and ask about them by name when you talk in the future.\nShe does not follow the path of a Klingon warrior, but she does have a strong sense of honor when it comes to honesty and keeping her word.\nShe wants a traditional Denobulan family with many wives and husbands, but her sense of romance is Klingon which has kept her from finding any spouses yet.\nShe has the temper of a Klingon, but she keeps it under such tight wraps that usually only an empath would be able to tell when she's angry. But she survived her childhood by out-Klingoning the Klingon children, and if she perceives someone as a bully they might see a side of her that few people ever meet. <br>Yalis' favorite place on the ship is the <a data-href=\"Crop Sciences Lab\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Crop Sciences Lab</a>. She enjoys being around all the plants. Yalis enjoys the \"seek out new life\" part of the Starfleet mission - she loves first contact, she loves learning about alien cultures and getting to know them, and she loves learning about their technology and biology.\nShe is particularly interested in what digestive systems can tell us about the evolution, culture, and environment of a species, and is delighted if an opportunity arises to acquire a new fecal sample.\nOn her first posting as an Ensign, her ship encountered the Scent-of-Blueberries-and-Ammonia, a non-humanoid species with an olfactory language. Using half-completed designs from her various projects, Yalis was able to create a biochemical/scent-based Universal Translator, leading to a successful first contact.\n<br>Yalis joined the crew of the <a data-href=\"USS Nightingale\" href=\"uss-nightingale.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">USS Nightingale</a> 6 months ago. She liked the idea of being directly involved in helping people while also being close to the frontier where contact with new species was likely.\nValue1:: I have a strong sense of honor when it comes to honesty and keeping my word.\nValue2:: When I see someone in distress, I try to help them.\nValue3:: Creative problem-solving can fix almost anything!\nValue4:: I will always stand up to a bully.\n<br>Yalis and <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Siltec Nol\" data-href=\"Siltec Nol\" href=\"crew/siltec-nol.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Siltec</a> share a love of horses.

Explains attorney/client privilege, Stoker doubts them, Tokmoth invokes Klingon honor, Stoker says not like she has a choice anyway. Tokmoth says Stoker has right to challenge them to a duel if defense not good.Opening arguments: Loxor opening argument was centered on General Orders 17 and 29 about not unnecessarily endangering Starfleet personnel or the Federation. Tokmoth opening argument is that it's our duty to explore but that we don't control what we find (invoked Prime Directive as an example) and that it's important fill in gaps with assumptions. Tokmoth says duty is to explore single question - did admiral stoker display both intent and ability to carry out crimes accused of.Review of facts, then lunch. Loxor interviewed Lt. Relza, who was against Stoker and saw no medical evidence for influence. Tokmoth talked further with Admiral Stoker, found out she considered herself a whistle-blower and that the Federation were exploiting the Tilikaal for their technology.Captain Zhao took the stand, asked questions by both sides. Loxor tried to build a case that the Tilikaal are an existential threat to the Federation. Tokmoth tried to build a case that it was Starfleet's duty to interact diplomatically with a species asking for help and that hostility and motivations can be difficult to interpret in unfamiliar cultures.Tokmoth spoke to Lt. Yalis, Yalis explained that Admiral doesn't have an ancient Tilikaal in her but does Yalis said Admiral used to be more cautious and that behavior changed after contact with artifact. Yalis also thinks Lt. Gray might have been mind-controlled into his stunt with the transporters and the ghosts.An initial interaction between Tokmoth and Algan Kader happened, can't remember if it was on the stand or asking questions.Out of courtroom, Yalis investigated artifact. Found it was broadcasting a wide/untargeted subspace signal that was probably a distress call. Also used a medical testing hologram to discover that it could have subtle effects on the brain that might affect thoughts/behavior. Yalis told Tokmoth about this. Got permission to use scanner on Admiral Stoker, Admiral Stoker's brain showed effects.Admiral Stoker took the stand, questioned by both Loxor first. If free and given a ship, she would go to a facility the Tilikaal told her about. Tried to establish a case that Stoker was serving the Tilikaal. Then Tokmoth asked questions - Admiral does not believe what she wants to do would endanger the Federation.During Admiral Stoker's questions with Tokmoth, Algan Kader noticed thoughts in the room. Admiral Krakt was angry the court martial was questioning her friend Admiral Stoker's honor. Admiral Nolan (the judge) was thinking lyrics to \"Twinkle twinkle little star\" to block mind-reading, on closer look Kader heard him think \"I have to convict her and remove her from the picture\" (referring to Admiral Stoker).Ensign Kader told Yalis he needed a disturbance so he could talk to Tokmoth. Yalis started some dyke drama with Relza and it escalated into punching, arrested, session went to recess. Kader told Tokmoth about what he heard in the judge's thoughts.When court reconvened, Tokmoth called Kader to the stand, and had him reveal what he had heard in the judge's thoughts. Admiral Krakt had Klingon security on the station arrest the judge, and a mistrial was declared.After the trial, Admiral Stoker resigned her commission, is now a civilian. Loxor and Tokmoth talked after court, acknowledged each-other as worthy adversaries, might even work together in the future. Tokmoth also talked to Ensign Kader and commended his bravery in coming forward and said helping cowards find their bravery to create a more honorable galaxy is why they became a lawyer.If Yalis is charged for the punch-up in the courtroom, Tokmoth will defend her.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#SessionSummary/Session"],"headers":[{"heading":"Summary","level":2,"id":"Summary_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"sessions/summaries/season-1/nightingale-log-9-order-in-court.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1757603434935,"modifiedTime":1759634333710,"sourceSize":5455,"sourcePath":"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Nightingale/Sessions/Summaries/Season 1/Nightingale Log 9 - Order in Court.md","exportPath":"sessions/summaries/season-1/nightingale-log-9-order-in-court.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":41,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"sessions/summaries/season-1/nightingale-log-10.1-rescue.html":{"title":"Nightingale Log 10.1 - Rescue","icon":"","description":"Starfleet Intelligence sources believed Siltec to be in custody of the Romulans as they attempted to learn more about the Cardassian Disruptor Spinal Lance technology.

Zephyr Grey, Nightingale, Federation citizen\", while the voices debated whether his “aderi” could be separated from his body in order to survive wherever he was. The entities ultimately judged him too fragile for the separation, though one insisted to Grey, “Open your mind.”Meanwhile, liquid from the crystal ship displayed micro-crystals communicating via light pulses. Siltec used a probe to establish rudimentary yes/no communication.Captain Akul arrived to guard the crystal structure while the Nightingale departed. At Pasqual IV, the crew found Zephyr Industries storing monoliths removed from Pasqual-1. The company had replaced them with replicas to protect the Prime Directive. Zephyr’s parents, <a data-href=\"Francis and Martine\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Francis and Martine</a>, were present and agreed to return the missing crystal samples.Just as the crew prepared to leave, radio transmissions were detected from Pasqual-1, it had a voice recording that said, “We know you’re out there.” Siltec experienced a sudden, vivid hallucination of a bat-filled cave and drew his phaser before being calmed by Vrenta. Lera Tharn discreetly confiscated Siltec’s phaser. Tricorder data later showed a burst of chroniton radiation, likely interacting with the crystal shard embedded in Siltec’s eye.Lera then negotiated with Zephyr Industries clerk Eric, who admitted a civilian operation was underway, led by Banna Stoker, which had been left off the official paperwork. Tharn provided Eric with sensor logs that would help them fast-track approval.Back on Pasqual-1, the crew met Gorf, a local who claimed the monolith spoke to them and promised ascension to the stars. He introduced Jasper, a monkey-tailed man who used a crude antenna to send messages to an “ark” they were expecting. Jasper described visions of an “angel” with horns, who told them to call for help in the stars and to prepare to leave the planet. T’Lar, a Starfleet anthropologist, discovered Jasper’s script appeared written by someone else and found a map of excavation efforts near a large underground object. Siltec followed the map to a field where a hole had been dug.Inside, they found a shrine with recent food offerings and a structure labeled “Here there be angels.” Inside was a vertical shaft leading to deeper facilities. The crew climbed down a machined ladder into a Tilikaal-like structure containing control panels and familiar architecture.They finally entered a room of stasis vats filled with black-skinned, nanotech-modified humanoids similar to the Ithik, but with stark mechanical augmentations and cybernetic cables.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#SessionSummary/Session"],"headers":[{"heading":"Summary","level":2,"id":"Summary_0"}],"links":[".html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"sessions/summaries/season-2/nightingale-log-14.1-pasqual's-progress.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1758875102141,"modifiedTime":1760094327812,"sourceSize":3505,"sourcePath":"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Nightingale/Sessions/Summaries/Season 2/Nightingale Log 14.1 - Pasqual's Progress.md","exportPath":"sessions/summaries/season-2/nightingale-log-14.1-pasqual's-progress.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":51,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"sessions/summaries/season-2/nightingale-log-14.2-assimilation.html":{"title":"Nightingale Log 14.2 - Assimilation","icon":"","description":"T’Lar, Siltec, and Vrenta ventured inside a chamber beneath a farmer's field on Pasqual-1, where they had discovered a long-buried Borg vessel.

They debated attacking immediately to destroy the borg, but they opted instead to investigate further.T’Lar returned to the ship while Holly, Rala, and Ujul beamed down to reinforce the away team. Rala noted that the Borg's telepathic field had a strange sense of bliss as if dreaming. Ujul scanned the jelly the borg were in and discovered a new segment on their nanites, seemingly optimized for assimilation, unlike Ithik nanites. While exploring the inside of the borg ship, Siltec hallucinated visions of his crewmates assimilated into borg drones.Deeper inside, they found multiple dormant drones and a chamber containing the “Face of Borg”, a cybernetic head floating in a jar. Analysis revealed this Borg vessel had crashed nearly 10,000 years ago and had remained dormant until recently, when its systems came back online. The Borg were now transmitting signals, hoping to be retrieved. They spoke of their “creators,” who they believed to be the Tilikaal, and claimed that true perfection could only be achieved by assimilating them.After extended discussion, the crew decided to attempt containment and de-assimilation, rather than destruction. Vrenta deployed sleeping gas to subdue the local populace, and Ujul constructed a makeshift nanite lab on the surface with Vodlin to study and eventually neutralize the Borg assimilation. The environment was secured with an EM field to hinder Borg communications.Rala, Siltec, and Holly returned to confront the Face of Borg. Rala attempted to deceive the Borg to allow them to disconnect it from the ship so that they can assist. The Borg was cautious, but Holly intimidated the Face of Borg, telling that ultimately its life is in their hands. There's nothing it can do.
