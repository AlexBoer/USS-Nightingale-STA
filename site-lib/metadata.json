She exchanged information for certain assurances, including the protection of her unborn son. Starfleet agreed and set them up in a safehouse: Zefram Cochrane's old Montana ranch, which had since been converted into a cultural center and basic survival training post for Starfleet cadets. Siltec grew up with a love for horses and big open night skies. He would lay on the roof at night and count the stars he would visit when he got to join Starfleet. His mother did not approve, and used her influence to ensure his bid for the academy would not be accepted. But she could stop him from enlisting. She could, however, influence where his first assignment was. Siltec's heart dropped when he opened his duty papers and saw that he was headed right back to the ranch where he grew up, under the watchful eye of his mother.<br>He spent a few years running young Starfleet officers through survival training bootcamp, then watched them leave to follow his dream among the stars.

Starfleet gets two things from this deal:\nSiltec is a good agent.\nOnce his mom got him back in the nest, she wasn't nearly as forthcoming with information, so Starfleet sees this as a way to use her son's safety (and constant updates on his whereabouts and actions) as a negotiating tool. <br>Siltec only had one request: a billet aboard the <a data-href=\"USS Nightingale\" href=\"uss-nightingale.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">USS Nightingale</a> and a path to adventure.<br>At some point between these two assignments, he went \"<a data-href=\"Behind Enemy Lines\" href=\"shackleton-expanse/lore/behind-enemy-lines.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Behind Enemy Lines</a>\" to do...something.

Her formative years were shaped by the independence and adaptability that life in space required, honing her instincts and skills long before formal training. She finds the gravity on most M class planets to be…weird, and has trouble sleeping without the hum of a starship. <br>At 16, during a trade negotiation mission with her family on Starbase 12, Valera seized a Federation shuttlecraft for a joyride; pushing the shuttle’s limits to evade capture, till she decided she was done and returned the shuttle. Her stunt captured the attention of <a data-href=\"Captain Liu\" href=\"crew/npcs/captain-liu.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Captain Liu</a>. Rather than meting out discipline, Liu recognized her aptitude and saw untapped potential in her. Convincing her that she could fly “further and faster” than ever before, the Liu sponsored her entry into Starfleet Academy, where Valera quickly rose to the top of her class in flight training.<br>When Liu (now Commander) was given a posting on the newly christened <a data-href=\"USS Nightingale\" href=\"uss-nightingale.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">USS Nightingale</a>, Valera (along with fellow mentee <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Kepler Faraday\" data-href=\"Kepler Faraday\" href=\"crew/supporting-characters/kepler-faraday.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Faraday</a>) was brought aboard to serve. When their mentor was given command of his own starship, Valera was offered a transfer and promotion, which she declined in order to stay on the Nightingale. This disappointed Faraday who told her she wasn’t living up to her potential, their friendship has been strained ever since.Cocky and sometimes brash, Valera wields humor as a shield, deflecting her insecurities with a mix of bravado and wit. Her ship and crew, however, have become her anchors, grounding her restless nature in camaraderie. She is a damn good pilot, and truly loves her ship. She’s going to be the greatest pilot Starfleet has ever seen, whatever it takes.Valera is loyal to a fault, and will step in to defend her crew. She doesn’t mind getting into trouble if it’s for “her people.”She sometimes tests the limits of her ship in ways that border on dangerous. She craves the rush of pushing technology—and herself—to the limit. This high tolerance for risk sometimes verges on carelessness, especially in tense or dangerous situations.She deflects emotional or vulnerable moments with humor, making it hard for others to see her true feelings or insecurities. Her humor can distance her from forming deeper relationships.Valera respects competence over rank.For Valera, the Nightingale isn’t just an assignment—it’s her family, a place she feels understood and needed in ways few can match.Value1:: No Home but the Stars\nValue2:: Push the Limit, Find the Balance\nValue3:: I am the Helm\nValue4:: There’s Always a Way\n<br>Both Velara and <a data-href=\"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Nightingale/Crew/Player Characters/Zephyr Grey\" href=\"crew/player-characters/zephyr-grey.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Nightingale/Crew/Player Characters/Zephyr Grey</a> grew up on the go and share a familiarity with being in space more-so than the ground.\n<br>Velara and <a data-href=\"Siltec Nol\" href=\"crew/player-characters/siltec-nol.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Siltec Nol</a> have a friendship forged in a common experience of being Starfleet ‘bad guys’ and occasionally getting shit for that. <br>Velara has gotten quite close with <a data-href=\"Jackson Hayes\" href=\"crew/supporting-characters/jackson-hayes.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Jackson Hayes</a> due to their shared experiences with <a data-href=\"Orion\" href=\"shackleton-expanse/locations/orion.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Orion</a> diplomacy. <a data-href=\"Jackson Hayes\" href=\"crew/supporting-characters/jackson-hayes.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Jackson Hayes</a> is a bit of a diplomatic brat and had seen his parents deal with Orions before.

Yalis enjoys the \"seek out new life\" part of the Starfleet mission - she loves first contact, she loves learning about alien cultures and getting to know them, and she loves learning about their technology and biology.\nShe is particularly interested in what digestive systems can tell us about the evolution, culture, and environment of a species, and is delighted if an opportunity arises to acquire a new fecal sample.\nOn her first posting as an Ensign, her ship encountered the Scent-of-Blueberries-and-Ammonia, a non-humanoid species with an olfactory language. Using half-completed designs from her various projects, Yalis was able to create a biochemical/scent-based Universal Translator, leading to a successful first contact.\n<br>Yalis joined the crew of the <a data-href=\"USS Nightingale\" href=\"uss-nightingale.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">USS Nightingale</a> 6 months ago. She liked the idea of being directly involved in helping people while also being close to the frontier where contact with new species was likely.\nValue1:: I have a strong sense of honor when it comes to honesty and keeping my word.\nValue2:: When I see someone in distress, I try to help them.\nValue3:: Creative problem-solving can fix almost anything!\nValue4:: I will always stand up to a bully.\n<br>Yalis and <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Siltec Nol\" data-href=\"Siltec Nol\" href=\"crew/player-characters/siltec-nol.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Siltec</a> share a love of horses.

I found out from Velara afterwards that we were falling into a sun at the time, but fortunately she was able to get us into a stable orbit once the engines were back online.We continued to Bacchus 3, where we found that the source of the subspace waves was a 10 km tall monolith, part of the ancient ruins on the planet's surface. The monolith was covered in runes in an unknown language.We landed and spoke to the colonists, who had glowing blue patches under their skin and appeared to be entranced by the monolith. They said they were trying to figure it out. They had a subspace relay activated and pointed towards the monolith, but it was not what was causing the monolith to produce the waves. Velara found readings of a power source similar to a warp core in the planet's core.There were two Klingons on the surface, who had arrived ahead of their ship. Their Bird of Prey was knocked out of warp shortly after the away team arrived on the surface, and the Nightingale tractored the Klingon ship out of danger.Lt. Gray and Siltec attempted to convince the colonists to come to our ship with us, and eventually persuaded them to accept treatment for radiation exposure. Janus included a sedative in the treatment administered, making it easier to herd the colonists.One Vulcan colonist was attempting to decipher the runes and was particularly resistant to stopping his work and going with Siltec - I offered to continue his work for him.

I was able to interpret some of the runes on the monolith and discovered one of them identified a button for opening the monolith.A Klingon shuttle was approaching, but turned back when Janus and I informed them the planet was under quarantine. The colonists on the ship were also placed in quarantine by the EMH.While we were dealing with that, Siltec went to look for the rest of the colonists. He didn't find them, but he took his shoes off for some reason and contact with the planet made his feet get glowy/blue and start phasing into subspace. (We also found out that colonists who were blue had stopped showing up/disappeared, and were concerned this would happen to Siltec's feet.)I used the colonists' dish to transmit an inverse wave at Siltec's feet and restore them to normal space. When the team on the ship returned, I asked them to bring a metal tape measure, and built a yagi that can act as a portable de-bluer. I also informed the EMH and Chief Sa'mi of the solution I had discovered.The Klingon shuttle went to the Nightingale, where Gray and Velara talked to them. They did a very good job convincing the Klingons to cooperate with our handling of the situation, and earned the respect of the Klingons (when Commander Gluk was rude, Velara said she didn't know they let targs command ships). They didn't seem too concerned about D'Loq and Brutog (the two Klingon colonists in sickbay), they were just upset that their ship had been knocked out of warp.When Gray and Velara came back to the surface, we opened the monolith. Janus was under the influence of the monolith and tried to run inside, but Siltec stopped her and I de-blued her. Her medical tricorder was thrown in and hit by a defensive beam. Siltec knocked out the security sensors and we continued inside.When we got to the control room, the computer verbally greeted us and recognized us as a worthy species. It then began an activation sequence. Holograms depicted the monoliths drawing mass from nearby planets, which is probably what they're being activated to do.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#SessionSummary/Logs"],"headers":[],"links":["sessions/summaries/nightingale-log-1.2-bacchus-3.html#_0","crew/player-characters/yalis.html#_0"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"sessions/logs/yalis-log-1.2.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1739598466708,"modifiedTime":1739598523347,"sourceSize":2378,"sourcePath":"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Nightingale/Sessions/Logs/Yalis Log 1.2.md","exportPath":"sessions/logs/yalis-log-1.2.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"sessions/logs/yalis-log-1.3.html":{"title":"Yalis Log 1.3","icon":"","description":"Session:: <a data-href=\"Nightingale Log 1.3 - Bacchus-3\" href=\"sessions/summaries/nightingale-log-1.3-bacchus-3.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Nightingale Log 1.3 - Bacchus-3</a><br>\nCharacter:: <a data-href=\"Yalis\" href=\"crew/player-characters/yalis.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Yalis</a>\nStardate:: 56452Log:: The computer and obelisks were built by the ancient Tikatal empire, and were pulling us into subspace because their mission was \"to look for more of our kind\" (this turned out to mean \"humanoid\").Valera hacked the planet (broke through their security systems) and with some creative engineering we were eventually able to beam out first an engineer from the colony named John, then all of the trapped people (including the ancient Tikatal, we didn't leave anyone behind).We also saved the Klingon ship the Yal'esh with some fancy flying from Valera and a de-bluer-enhanced explosion.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#SessionSummary/Logs"],"headers":[],"links":["sessions/summaries/nightingale-log-1.3-bacchus-3.html#_0","crew/player-characters/yalis.html#_0"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"sessions/logs/yalis-log-1.3.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1739598549102,"modifiedTime":1739598595452,"sourceSize":758,"sourcePath":"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Nightingale/Sessions/Logs/Yalis Log 1.3.md","exportPath":"sessions/logs/yalis-log-1.3.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"sessions/logs/yalis-log-2.html":{"title":"Yalis Log 2","icon":"","description":"Session:: <a data-href=\"Nightingale Log 2 A Klingon Christmas\" href=\"sessions/summaries/nightingale-log-2-a-klingon-christmas.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Nightingale Log 2 A Klingon Christmas</a><br>\nCharacter:: <a data-href=\"Yalis\" href=\"crew/player-characters/yalis.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Yalis</a>\nStardate:: 56980.82Log:: Kamin joined us for this session as Betazoid doctor Lt. Cmdr. Rennan Kader.We delivered presents (mostly weapons, also targs) to Klingon children on several colony planets along the border for the Klingon holiday of Tor'Gos.At the first planet we visited (Khitomer), we had to go down in a shuttle because the transporter couldn't reach some of the houses. Klingon children fired surface to air missiles at our shuttle, and we discovered it is customary for Klingon children to attack Klingon Santa (who was named Gar'Nash at first but later mutated to Gash'Nar). We retaliated by beaming balloons full of targ manure over their heads. (Balloons were produced by Rennan and Yalis wrestling a targ and giving it a laxative, then collecting the result.)At the second planet we visited (Beta Thoridor) there was subspace-related lightening in the atmosphere, and Valera was able to fly us under it. We completed that delivery pretty quickly. We also discovered there was a pathogen in the targ manure that made our skin emit a pheromone that smelled delicious to some predator animals, but fortunately Rennan was able to program the transporters to eliminate it (assisted by Bas Sa'mi).The third planet we visited (H'atoria) seemed uneventful until several Klingon children beamed aboard the ship and attacked Rennan in sickbay. He eventually got them to go out into the hallway by telepathically projecting the voice of Gash'Nar into their heads taunting them about looking in the wrong place. We then distracted them with a holographic Gash'Nar in the hallway, which kept them busy fighting until they could be beamed back to their homes.The fourth planet we visited (Gamma Eridon) was on the Klingon-Romulan border and had colonists of both species on the planet. Three Romulan ships were on the planet and tried to stop us from \"delivering weapons to the planet\". We attempted to explain to the Romulans that they were \"childrens' weapons\" and demonstrated the use of a targ poop balloon (Rennan threw it an Yalis), but the Romulans weren't convinced. We beamed targs onto the Romulan ships to keep them distracted while we made our deliveries, and then some clever flying by Valera (plus a targ chewing something near a Romulan warp core - thanks Kamin!) got us out of there without the Romulans being able to follow.The last planet we visited was Narendra, an important planet in the history of Klingon-Federation relations (this is where Captain Garret of the Enterprise-C made her heroic sacrifice to save Klingons from a Romulan sneak attack). Tor'Gos celebrations on this world typically involve a federation ship flying over the planet and detonating in the sky to commemorate the occasion. We decided that we would do something to the warp drive of a shuttle to make it able to sky-write Qapla' in glowing letters over the planet, then blow it up. Valera decided to fly the shuttle herself instead of having it on auto-pilot, but it didn't go well and she knocked the head off the statue of Captain Garret.

Yalis swung around on the stalactites and shined light in Siltec's eyes to blind him. Siltec threw Relza at her. Siltec thought he had won, but since his phaser was pointed at Relza (who was on Yalis), Yalis grabbed Siltec's ankle to pull him to the ground, then took his hat hostage to win the sparring.Vrenta Awasi and Admiral Stoker met us at the doors to the holodeck with a mission, and gave us a data PADD with information about an artifact recently stolen from the station. The block looked like sandstone, was a few feet in size was gem-shaped like a mini-monolith, and had runes on it like we had encountered at Baccus 3. The artifact was found on the nearby planet Dinassia 2. It was scanned before the theft - no energy emissions, but it had certain alloys under the surface (they couldn't scan much deeper). It was stolen 2 days ago, after the Nightingale had deactivated the Baccus 3 monolith.We checked out the archive it was stolen from - someone had entered without using the door, and we found a transporter signature consistent with Orien transporters. There was only one Orien ship in the area recently, the SS Castlerock, a freighter/merchant ship under the command of Captain Peljara. We told Admiral Stoker what we found, then took the runabout the McKenzie to go after them.We caught up with the McKenzie near the edge of the Romulan neutral zone. Subspace waves were present, and Yalis applied the debluer modifications to the runabout's deflector to create subspace shielding.Velara told them they had forgotten to pay the \"neutral zone identification fee\" (implying an Orien bribe), and they agreed to let us onboard. Before we came onboard, the back end of the Casterock appeared to be crushed like a can, there was a containment breach, and things started to float out but were then pulled back in.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#SessionSummary/Logs"],"headers":[],"links":["sessions/summaries/nightingale-log-3.1-orion-heist.html#_0","crew/player-characters/yalis.html#_0"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"sessions/logs/yalis-log-3.1.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1739702838176,"modifiedTime":1739702903723,"sourceSize":2256,"sourcePath":"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Nightingale/Sessions/Logs/Yalis Log 3.1.md","exportPath":"sessions/logs/yalis-log-3.1.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"sessions/logs/yalis-log-3.2.html":{"title":"Yalis Log 3.2","icon":"","description":"Session:: <a data-href=\"Nightingale Log 3.2 - Orion Heist\" href=\"sessions/summaries/nightingale-log-3.2-orion-heist.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Nightingale Log 3.2 - Orion Heist</a><br>\nCharacter:: <a data-href=\"Yalis\" href=\"crew/player-characters/yalis.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Yalis</a>\nStardate:: 57019Log:: Stolen artifact may be some kind of controller for monolithsWe were on the runabout MacKenzie, chasing the Orien ship SS CastlerockAway team went to Castlerock, Artax stayed with shuttle.

Self-sustaining, now able to export crops, also trying to introduce some of their plant species on other colonies.1-week trip from Ray Alpha to Yacci system, taking exports and passengers.Yalis taught the kids a Klingon game which she modified so that instead of sneaking up and hitting each-other on the back of the head with sticks they sneak up and leave thumb prints on the backs of each-others' heads in water-soluble easily-washable paint. By night she analyzes stool samples to see how the superfoods are affecting the gut microbiome.Radix Bina (she) is a joined trill, lead crop scientist from the planet. There are some bushes called \"ice peas\"Janis had an allergic reaction to the ice peas, a kid Yalis was chasing had a reaction, Yalis took kid to sick bay, doctor identified ice peas were over-producing a particular protein that triggered the reaction. (I'm naming the kid Brom.) Gray also had an allergic reaction and went to sickbay.Velara (who also ate a berry) didn't have an allergic reaction but noticed how nice Janus' spots were. Janus put the crop lab on lockdown when she first had a reaction.Much horniness ensued, with people who hadn't eaten berries becoming wildly attracted to adults who had (or developing strong protective/parenting instincts towards kids who had).Yalis' girlfriend Relza went off with Gray (who had eaten a berry), but he avoided sleeping with her and just led her back to sickbay.Janus and Velara were very, very into each-other in sickbay. Siltec and the Vulcan went off together. Yalis became extremely protective of the kids, and alternated between trying to find a cure and encouraging the children to observe the fascinating display of mating behaviors.It turned out that when separated from their native soil the ice peas made a protein that caused all of this. The captain was eating a bowl of the peas and watching a movie. We eventually released an aerosolized cure in the ship's ventilation systems. Janus and Velara had a difficult time with this because they didn't want to stop feeling what they felt for each-other, but eventually managed to put the ship and crew first.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#SessionSummary/Logs"],"headers":[],"links":["sessions/summaries/nightingale-log-4-peas-to-meet-you.html#_0","crew/player-characters/yalis.html#_0"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"sessions/logs/yalis-log-4.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1739703040210,"modifiedTime":1739703122280,"sourceSize":2530,"sourcePath":"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Nightingale/Sessions/Logs/Yalis Log 4.md","exportPath":"sessions/logs/yalis-log-4.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"sessions/logs/zephyr-grey-log-1.1.html":{"title":"Zephyr Grey Log 1.1","icon":"","description":"Session:: <a data-href=\"Nightingale Log 1.1 - Bacchus-3\" href=\"sessions/summaries/nightingale-log-1.1-bacchus-3.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Nightingale Log 1.1 - Bacchus-3</a><br>\nCharacter:: <a data-href=\"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Nightingale/Crew/Player Characters/Zephyr Grey\" href=\"crew/player-characters/zephyr-grey.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Nightingale/Crew/Player Characters/Zephyr Grey</a>\nStardate:: 56241Log:: The USS Nightingale lost power due to a subspace gravitational wave while in transit to Bacchus-3.
